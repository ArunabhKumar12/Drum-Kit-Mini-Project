document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", handleClick );
This is sets up a function to be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target
1st param is the event type which we have to listen to
2nd param is the listener which is usually a JS function thats goin to be called when the click event is detected
Note(imp): if we add () while callimng the fucntion like handleClick() then the functionwould automatically be called without the completion of the event
Note(imp): without using () , we are passing the function name as an input so that it can be called at a later(ie after completion of the event)

function handleClick(){
  alert("I got clicked");
}

Method 2 of the above procedure

document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function(){
alert("I got clicked")
});

Here we are using an anonymous function which will be called and will be performing the given instructions after the completion of the given event
These functions arem called higher order functions as they can take other functions as inputs

var audio = new Audio("sounds/tom-1.mp3");
audio.play();
here audio is the var name
By new Audio we are creating an HTML Audio Elem

this
this keyword is the identity of the button that triggered the EventListener

For eg: so properties that can be used using the this keyword
console.log(this);
console.log(this.innerHTML);
this.style.color="white";

Syntax for adding audio as an event
mySound = new Audio([URL String]);


Topic : Javascript Objects
For eg:
var houseKeeper1 = {
    name : "Jane",
    age : "35 yrs",
    yearsOfExperience : 12,
    cleaningJobs:["Bathroom","Lobby","Bedroom"]
}

function BellBoy(name , age , hasWorkPermit , languages){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.hasWorkPermit = hasWorkPermit;
    this.languages = languages;
}
This is called a Constructor Function
Note: The 1st letter of the 1st word of the name of the constructor function has to be a capital. It takes a number of inputs

Initialising an Object of the given constructor function
var bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("Timmy", 19 , true , ["French", "English"]);

function Housekeeper(name , age , yearsOfExperience , cleaningJobs){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.yearsOfExperience = yearsOfExperience;
    this.cleaningJobs = cleaningJobs;

}

Initialising the object of the given constructor function
var houseKeeper1 = new Housekeeper("Jane" , 35 , 12 , ["Bathroom" , "Kitchen" , "Bedroom" , "Lobby"]);

Topic: Including methods in constructor functions
For eg
function Housekeeper(name , age , yearsOfExperience , cleaningJobs){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.yearsOfExperience = yearsOfExperience;
    this.cleaningJobs = cleaningJobs;
    this.clean = function(){
        alert("Cleaning in progress...");
    }

    Guessing the constructor function of HTML audio elem
    For eg:
    var tom1 = new Audio("sounds/tom-1.mp3");
    tom1.play();

    function Audio(fileLocation){
    this.fileLocation = fileLocation;
    Note: Audio is the name of the object that the function would construct
    Note: fileLocation is the property
    this.click = function(){
        Tap into the audio hardware
        Check the file at fileLocation exists
        Check the file at fileLocation is a sound fileLocation
        Play the file at fileLocation
      }
    }

    Now initialising the object that will use the constructor fucntion audio
    var tom1 = new Audio("sounds/tom-1.mp3");
    tom.play();
